              <h2>Coffee</h2> 
        <p>
        coffee is beverage brewed from the roasted and ground seeds of the tropical evergreen coffee plants of African origin. 
        Coffee is one of the three most popular beverages in the world (alongside water and tea) and one of the most
        profitable international commodities. Though coffee is the basis for an endless array of beverages,
        including espresso, cappuccinos, mochas, and lattes, its popularity is mainly attributed to its invigorating 
        effect, which is produced by caffeine, an alkaloid present in coffee.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      
        Two species of coffee plants, Coffea arabica and C. canephora, supply almost all of the world’s consumption.
        Arabica is considered a milder and more flavourful and aromatic brew than Robusta, the main variety of C. 
        canephora. The flatter and more elongated Arabica bean is more widespread than Robusta but more delicate and 
        vulnerable to pests, requiring a cool subtropical climate; Arabica must grow at higher elevations (2,000–6,500 
        feet [600–2,000 metres]), it needs a lot of moisture, and it has fairly specific shade requirements.
